# Overview
## Description
NeverSnooze is an innovative alarm app that ensures users wake up on time and stay awake. By incorporating a variety of customizable activities, such as shaking the phone or solving puzzles, it ensures users engage with the app to fully shut off their alarm.


## App Evaluation
* Category: Health & Lifestyle / Productivity
* Mobile: NeverSnooze leverages the full potential of a mobile device, utilizing features such as sound notifications, calendar sync, phone shakes, and gyroscope to engage users and ensure they are truly awake. The app will provide an interactive experience that's mobile-first, which is the core differentiator.
* Story: NeverSnooze focuses on helping users wake up and stay alert, ensuring they don't fall back into the snooze trap. The app's unique wake-up activities engage users with interactive puzzles, tasks, and phone motions, making the waking process more effective.
* Market: NeverSnooze appeals to a broad market, especially heavy sleepers, people with deadlines, students, professionals, and anyone looking for an innovative solution to waking up on time. The market is huge and includes people who are prone to hitting the snooze button too many times or need help getting out of bed on time.
* Habit: Users will likely interact with NeverSnooze mostly twice a day—once to set alarms at night, and again when the alarm goes off in the morning. The app is designed to become a part of their waking routine, creating a new healthy habit of engagement.
* Scope: The alarm feature itself is a basic, well-documented mobile feature. The challenge lies in building and integrating wake-up activities (e.g., shaking the phone, solving puzzles) and using advanced phone features such as touch interactions to ensure users stay awake.
